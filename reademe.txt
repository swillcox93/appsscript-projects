Node application developed in  Vue
  - Node is a server which executes javascript code
  - Vue is a framework for building single page javascript apps
  - Vue apps are built as individual components which are built
    into a single application.
      - the build process uses Webpack, which compresses all files
        into a single one which the browser can execute
  - the table is reactive, and upates automatically
    - we use vue properties which alert subscribers
      of any changes to their value.
  - the graphs must be triggered by clicking buttons.

Dependencies are managed with NPM - the node package manager.

Most important dependency are chartjs and its wrapper vue-chartjs
  - implemented in LineChart.js
  - custom graph with two datasets, one standardized theoretical and
    one based on user provided data

Unit tests allow testing outside of the browser.
The app uses Jest for unit tests.
Jest has descriptice assertions.
  - in particular we use the assetion "expect(x).toBeCloseTo(y)"
    - this is useful because the table data are decimal values,
      we only need accuracy with within a couple of major decimal points.

Our unit tests do not cover application code
  - application code is that which we see as the end result
  - this would require automation testing (time consuming, not very effective)

TODO:
remove .git
create a new one
ctrl-h in explorer will reveal hidden files
